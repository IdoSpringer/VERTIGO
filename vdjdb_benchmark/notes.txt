# there are already some models in the VDJdb benckmark -
check https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-classifier-benchmark

# NetTCR is the most similar method to ERGO.
They provided scores for a csv file of positive and negative samples for 3 peptides.
Lets try sticking to this file.

# ERGO website predicts well, but it used VDJdb as training database.
we can train on mcpas, but we should (and requested to) do 10 fold cross validation

# let's compare AUC for our current predictions and then try to train again with cross validation

# first try without V and J, later we will add it (by querying database)
